# Procedure - Debriefing Session

This document describes how debriefing sessions
are organized so that it is sustainable.

## Terminology

-   **SCF**: Software Carpentry Foundation.

-   **DC**: Data Carpentry.

-   **Debriefing session**: is an online meeting
    where instructors could share experience about the workshops
    they recently taught.

-   **Facilitator**: is one member of the Mentoring Subcommittee
    that attend the debriefing session to coordinate it
    and write one blog post about it.

## We Need a Debriefing Session

1.  SCF and DC are community based project
    and the community need opportunity to interact.

2.  SCF and DC believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study",
    and evidence-based education
    so instructors need opportunity to exchange experience.

## Let's do a Debriefing Session

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing
the debriefing sessions so that

-   each month has at least one debriefing session,

-   instructors are notify with at least one week in advance and

-   the session has a facilitator to conduct the discussion.

The **facilitator** is responsible to provide one place
