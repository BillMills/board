#Guidelines for checkout discussion sessions

This document outlines some things that can be discussed during the checkout discussion sessions. The sessions are meant to be student driven, but some groups may be quieter than others. This is by no means an exhaustive list, other subjects are bound to come up. 

## Beforehand:

* Video connection
	* The discussion lead is free to use the Software Carpentry persistent BlueJean 	connection if they prefer, other options are hangouts and skype. The lead needs to 	ensure that information about the connection is posted to the discussion sessions 	etherpad so that people will know how to join.

## During:
* Inform students that a summary of the discussion will be kept in the etherpad, and that ideas and issues may be culled for future use by the SCF. Also remind students that the Etherpad is a public, persistent document.
* Give an orientation of how the checkout procedure itself goes:
	* A signup etherpad will be sent out. Choose your subject, and sign up for a 
	session. Around 5 people gather on a hangout with one of the trainers. Each person 	will have 5 minutes to present a section of the material. The trainer will dictate 	where in the material the student should start. Please note that the student is 	expected to be able to teach with little to no reference to the material during these 	5 minutes. After the presentation, there will be 5 minutes for feedback from the 	trainer and the other participants. All will be notified afterwards by email 	whether they passed or not.
* Make sure that all know where the lesson material can be found. Ensure that they all know about the instructor guide. 
* Discuss the fact that the lesson material is under continous development. Tell the students that any and all changes to the lesson material that might improve on it is welcome. If anybody have any comments on the material, they are very welcome. 
* Go through each of the modules in the lesson. Ask if anybody have any problems, questions or comments about the module. Does anybody have thoughts about changes or additions or things that can be removed? This walkthrough is particulary important if any of the participants are on the quieter side, it is important that we ensure that all of the students get to discuss their issues. In cases where all participants are vocal, a structured walkthrough may not be necessary.

## After:

* If any of the participants seemed unprepared, and had no questions, send them an email after the session asking them to sign up for another discussion session. 
* Report to the trainers the people who were in your session, and whether you deemed them ready to go forth to the checkout session.
