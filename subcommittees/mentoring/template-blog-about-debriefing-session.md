On MM DD we ran the XX round of post-workshop instructor debriefing ...

## Installation problem

<!--
If any new installation problem was reported it should be mention here.
If only the usual installation problem was reported,
for example someone with old version of OS X,
this section can be cut off.
-->

## New lesson

<!--
If someone used a new lesson
or made some awesome change
it should goes here.
-->

## Worked well

<!--
If something new worked well,
for example use two projectors,
it should goes here.
-->

## Went wrong

<!--
If something went wrong,
for example have students work at the fork of one Git repository,
it should goes here.
-->

## Thanks

We are grateful to the instructors who attended debriefing sessions this round:
