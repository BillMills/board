# Instructor Training Selection

**Warning: This only applies for the free/open two-day training course in December 2015.**

## Terminology

-   An **instructor** is someone who teaches a workshop.
    Instructor training (IT) prepares them to do this.

## Notation

-   **SCF**: Software Carpentry Foundation.
-   **DC**: Data Carpentry.

## Why Select Students for Instructor Training

SCF wants to train as many instructors as possible
but demand for instructor training is higher than what SCF is able to offer
at the moment.

## Eligibility

We expect all students to gather in groups
that are able to co-locate in one room for the duration of the Instructor Training.
Each group should commit to jointly run one workshop no later than April 1st, 2016.
**Please note: how to run a workshop is covered in the curriculum.**

### Participation in a group

The members of the group should be on the current waiting list
or
demonstrate sufficient competence with core tools used in the lessons they will teach.

Each student is expected to:

-   Watch one of the two videos below
    and submit a paragraph of feedback on the video they chose to watch
    as part of their application.

    - https://vimeo.com/139316669
    - https://vimeo.com/139181120

-   **Only** students interested in teaching for Software Carpentry need to
    submit a pull request to the specified GitHub repository.

    Your pull request should contain one file (and one file only) called
    "your_name.txt" (e.g., marie_curie.txt or alan_turing.txt). This file
    should contain a sentence or two that describes the type of work you do.
    You will submit the name of this file as part of your application.

    Help on creating pull requests can be found at
    https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.

    If you need assistance, please mail training-help@software-carpentry.org.

## Application

Groups **must** fill out
[this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fzm6HQt5RWyzbCSMmwj_8G78vlP7kXlT5sGjARXhjYM/viewform)
to apply for the two-day training course in December 2015.
There is a cover letter sample at the end of this document.

## Selection Criteria

Groups will be selected based on:

-   Group members were involved in SCF/DC,
    e.g. members were learners, helpers or instructors in a workshop,
    members have opened issues or pull request to one of SCF/DC lessons.

-   Group members were involved in a group that organizes Software Carpentry-like workshops,
    e.g. [The Hacker Within](https://thehackerwithin.github.com/),
    Python and R local user groups.

-   The group's plan for the follow-up workshop.

Groups will **not** be selected based on:

-   **Affiliation with a particular institution, lab, or university.**
    All groups will be considered equally.

-   **Academic qualification.**
    Faculty and students will be considered equally,
    as will groups from different academic disciplines.

## Selection

Each member of the mentoring subcommittee
will have one vote for each group slot for the Instructor Training round.
Groups with the highest number of votes will be invited for the Instructor Training
until all slots are allocated.

## Group Confirmation Process

Selected groups will have one week to confirm participation.
If they fail to do so,
their slot will be given to the next group in sequence.

## Application Sample

Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

we are writing to express our interested
to attend the two-day training course in December 2015
as one group composed by:

-   NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
-   NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
-   NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
-   NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),
-   NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub) and
-   NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub).

NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT
attended a SCF workshop in 2014,
NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT
attended a SCF workshop in 2015.
and
NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT
attended a DC workshop in 2015.
NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT was a helper at the last SCF/DC workshop organized at our university
that was lead by INSTRUCTOR_NAME.

If we are selected for the instructor training
we will use the conference room of our department
that you can check below.
We already made reservations for that room
in advance.

We are planing to organize two workshops at the beginning of 2016.
One will be Python based and will have
NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT,
NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT,
NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT and
INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
The other one will be R based and will have
NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT,
NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT,
NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT and
INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
We will use the same room used for the last workshop
and we already talked with INSTRUCTOR_NAME about those workshops.

Thanks for your consideration.
