# Instructor Training Selection

**Warning: This is only a draft.**

**Warning: This only apply for the two-day training course in December 2015.**

## Terminology

-   An **instructor** is someone who teaches a workshop. Instructor training (IT)
    prepares them to do this.

## Why Select Attends for Instructor Training

SCF wants to train as more instructors as possible
but demand for instructor training is higher than what SCF could offer
at the moment.
For the free/open online training SCF hopes to satisfy
the demand for instructor training from their community
that isn't associate with one partner or affiliate
and could participate at the Instructor Training
delivered for partners and affiliates.

## Eligibility

### Groups

-   With 4-6 people.
-   Co-locate in one room for the two days
-   Commit to jointly running one workshop no longer then April 1st, 2016.

### Members

-   Be on the current waiting list
    or
    demonstrate sufficient competence with core tools used in the lessons they will teach.

-   Watch a short video of someone teaching part of our core lessons and
    write a summary of what was taught and how. Participants in the Fall
    2015 pilot will be required to complete this step, and we will
    select segments from the videos from SciPy 2015.

## Application

Groups **must** send a cover letter to [ADDRESS TO SEND COVER LETTER]()
to apply for the two-day training course in December 2015.
There is a cover letter sample at the end of this document.

## Selection Criteria

Groups will be selected based on:

-   Previous contribution to SCF,
    e.g. members were learners, helpers or instructors in a workshop,
    members open issues or pull request to one of SCF lessons.

-   Previous contribution to one group that organizes Software Carpentry-like workshops,
    e.g. [The Hacker Within](https://thehackerwithin.github.com/),
    Python and R local user groups.

-   Plan for the local organization of the Instructor Training.

-   Plan for the upcoming workshop.

Groups will not be selected based on:

-   Affiliation,
    i.e. one group from Harvard will have the same opportunity
    that one grup from University of Cape Town.

-   Academic qualification,
    i.e. one group of professors will have the same opportunity
    that one group of undergraduate students.

The criteria for tie will be:

-   timezones,
    because instructor trainers and instructor in-training
    should not be required to wake up too much early or saty up to much late.

-   small number of instructors at city/province/state/country,
    because SCF believes that increase the numbers of instructors
    at one region will help increase the number of workshops
    at that region and with that achive their goal.

## Selection

Each members of

-   the mentoring subcommittee,
-   SCF steering committee and
-   DC steering committee

will have one vote for each group slot for the Instructor Training round.

Members of more than one committee
**will only have one vote per group slot**.

For example,
there will be eight slots
and the committees composition are:

-   Mentoring subcommittee: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8.
-   SCF steering committee: S1, S2, S3, S4.
-   DC steering committee: D1, D2, D3, D4.

So,
M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8,
S1, S2, S3, S4,
D1, D2, D3, and D4
will have eight votes each.

## Group Confirmation Process

After all the groups were ranked,
the groups at the top of the rank will be contacted by email
requesting a email confirmation that they still available
to be part of the Instructor Training.

## Application Sample

Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

we are writing to express our interested
to attend the two-day training course in December 2015
as one group composed by:

-   A1, very small (< 100 words) bibliography;
-   A2, very small (< 100 words) bibliography;
-   A3, very small (< 100 words) bibliography;
-   A4, very small (< 100 words) bibliography;
-   A5, very small (< 100 words) bibliography;
-   A6, very small (< 100 words) bibliography.

Every member of our group attended SCF workshops at least once.
A1 taught X at the last SCF workshop organized at our university
that was lead by INSTRUCTOR_NAME.
At that same workshop A2 and A3 were helpers.

A4 is the organizer of the Python MeetUp meetings at our university.
A5 is the organizer of the R MeetUp meetings at our university.

If we are selected for the instructor training
we will use the conference room of our department
that you can check below.
We already made reservations for that room
in advance.

We are planing to organize two workshops at the begin of 2016.
One will be Python based and will have A1, A2, A4 and INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
The other one will be R based and will have A3, A5, A6 and INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
We will use the same room used for the last workshop
and we already talked with INSTRUCTOR_NAME about those workshops.

Thanks for your consideration.
