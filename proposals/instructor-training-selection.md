# Instructor Training Selection

**Warning: This is only a draft.**

**Warning: This only applies for the two-day training course in December 2015.**

## Terminology

-   An **instructor** is someone who teaches a workshop. Instructor training (IT)
    prepares them to do this.

## Why Select Attends for Instructor Training

SCF/DC wants to train as more instructors as possible
but demand for instructor training is higher than what SCF could offer
at the moment.

## Eligibility

### Groups

-   Be able to Co-locate in one room for the two days
-   Commit to jointly running one workshop no later than April 1st, 2016.

### Members of the groups

-   Be on the current waiting list
    or
    demonstrate sufficient competence with core tools used in the lessons they will teach.

-   Watch one of the two videos below
    and submit a paragraph of feedback on the video you chose to watch
    as part of your application.

-   Submit a pull request to the GitHub repository at
    https://github.com/swcarpentry/training-prep-2015-09.

    Your pull request should contain one file (and one file only) called
    "your_name.txt" (e.g., marie_curie.txt or alan_turing.txt). This file
    should contain a sentence or two that describes the type of work you do.
    You will submit the name of this file as part of your application.

## Application

Groups **must** fill
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fzm6HQt5RWyzbCSMmwj_8G78vlP7kXlT5sGjARXhjYM/edit?usp=sharing
to apply for the two-day training course in December 2015.
There is a cover letter sample at the end of this document.

## Selection Criteria

Groups will be selected based on:

-   Previous involvement to SCF/DC,
    e.g. members were learners, helpers or instructors in a workshop,
    members open issues or pull request to one of SCF/DC lessons.

-   Previous involvement to a group that organizes Software Carpentry-like workshops,
    e.g. [The Hacker Within](https://thehackerwithin.github.com/),
    Python and R local user groups.

-   Plan for the follow-up workshop.

Groups will not be selected based on:

-   **Affiliation with a particular institution, lab, or university.**
    All groups will be considered equally.

-   **Academic qualification**
    Faculty and students will be considered equally,
    as will groups from different academic disciplines.

## Selection

Each members of the mentoring subcommittee
will have one vote for each group slot for the Instructor Training round.
Groups with the highest number of votes will be invited for the Instructor Training
until all slots are allocated.

## Group Confirmation Process

If they fail to do so,
their slot will be given to the next group in sequence.

## Application Sample

Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,

we are writing to express our interested
to attend the two-day training course in December 2015
as one group composed by:

-   A1,
-   A2,
-   A3,
-   A4,
-   A5 and
-   A6.

Every member of our group attended SCF/DC workshops at least once.
A1 taught X at the last SCF/DC workshop organized at our university
that was lead by INSTRUCTOR_NAME.
At that same workshop A2 and A3 were helpers.

A4 is the organizer of the Python MeetUp meetings at our university.
A5 is the organizer of the R MeetUp meetings at our university.

If we are selected for the instructor training
we will use the conference room of our department
that you can check below.
We already made reservations for that room
in advance.

We are planing to organize two workshops at the begin of 2016.
One will be Python based and will have A1, A2, A4 and INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
The other one will be R based and will have A3, A5, A6 and INSTRUCTOR_NAME
as instructors.
We will use the same room used for the last workshop
and we already talked with INSTRUCTOR_NAME about those workshops.

Thanks for your consideration.
