Organizational Membership
=========================

Terminology
-----------

*   An *internal* workshop is one whose audience is mainly from the host
    organization (e.g., a workshop run by the University of Melbourne
    for staff and students of the University of Melbourne).

*   An *external* workshop is one whose audience is mainly for people not
    at or from the host organization (e.g., a workshop organized by the
    University of Melbourne but run at the University of Wollongong).

*   *Coordinating* a workshop means handling the administration involved
    in lining up instructors, administering assessment questionnaires,
    providing information on attendees to the SCF, etc.  Staff working
    for the organizer do not necessarily teach the workshop.

*   *Hosting* a workshop means providing space for it, supporting travel
    costs for instructors (if applicable), etc.

*   The *administration fee* is the fee the SCF charges per workshop to
    support curriculum development, instructor training, and central
    administrative costs.  The amount is specified in the current version
    of the workshop guidelines.
