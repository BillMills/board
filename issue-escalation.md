Issue Escalation
================

This document contains guidance notes for issue escalation and
communications between workshop coordinators, the project lead, and
the Board.  It is meant to evolve over time.

Issues Requiring Board Clearance
--------------------------------

* Offers of sponsorship for individual workshops
* Fee waivers for individual workshops
* Instructor training classes

Note: Code of Conduct issues should always be brought to the project
lead's attention, even if they have already been handled by the
workshop instructors.  The project lead should summarize any such
events at Board meetings and provide details if requested.

Who to Contact
--------------

If an item that requires Board clearance comes up - or if a workshop
coordinator is simply unsure or has a question - the first point of
contact is the project lead.  If for any reason the workshop
coordinator feels the project lead's response is unsatisfactory, he or
she should approach a member of the Board directly.

(Having said that, all Board members have indicated that they are
happy to be contacted directly by workshop coordinators, so don't be
shy!)

Urgent Issues
-------------

If the project lead (or any other Board member) has an issue that
requires Board clearance prior to the next scheduled Board meeting,
decisions can be made via email according to the following process:

* The project lead (or Board member) emails the Board outlining the issue

* Within one week, Board members respond with either:
  * their approval;
  * suggested amendments to the proposal/issue; or
  * a request to delay any decision until the next Board meeting

An issue can be acted upon as soon as an approval response has been
posted by more than three quarters of Board members, provided there
are no requests for amendments or delay. Otherwise, at the end of the
week the responses are tallied:

* If all responses approve and more than half the Board have
  responded, the issue can be acted upon

* Otherwise the project lead (or Board member) must amend the
  issue/proposal and start the process again, or add the issue to the
  agenda for the next meeting
