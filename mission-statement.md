# Mission Statement

The Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF) is a non-profit membership
organization devoted to improving basic computing skills among
researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and other disciplines.
It is a member of NumFOCUS, and as such, it qualifies under the US
Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and
educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the
rules for such organizations.

Our long-term goal is to ensure that every researcher learns the
skills that SC teaches early in their career, whether through us or
because what we teach has become part of the standard curriculum for
their discipline.  What's more, we want to:

* partner with a steadily growing group of like-minded organizations
  who can provide or help support core staff, coordinate training, act
  as regional hubs for our activities, and/or give our learners and
  instructors somewhere to go next;

* foster sibling organizations to cater to the needs of other learning
  communities;

* have a significant fraction of learners become instructors, so that
  we can continue to grow;

* have a significant fraction of instructors regularly contribute to
  our teaching materials, so that they can also continue to grow;

* be financially self-sustaining;

* systematically assess what they have learned, used, and passed on,
  so that we can improve our content, delivery, and instructor
  training; and

* most importantly, have a significant, demonstrable impact on the
  quality of scientific research, on the productivity of the average
  researcher, and on the adoption of open science.

In aid of these goals, the SCF:

* Coordinates development of the core Software Carpentry lessons,
  which are made available to the public free of charge under a
  liberal open access license.

* Establishes those licenses for SCF material to ensure the rights of
  the public to freely obtain, use, redistribute, and modify
  intellectual property held by the SCF.

* Holds Software Carpentry's intellectual property rights.
  
* Protects the Software Carpentry name, and the names, service marks
  and trademarks associated with all other intellectual property held
  by the SCF.

* Solicits and manages contributions to Software Carpentry's lessons,
  both for its own purposes and on behalf of other open educational
  projects.

* Partners with like-minded organizations to coordinate training and
  advocate for adoption of better computing practices and more
  openness in research.

* Raises funds to support SCF programs and services in ways that are
  consistent with its standing as an open source project and
  non-profit organization.

* Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing
  development of Software Carpentry's lessons and related
  materials. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a
  public web site, planning workshops and similar events, and offering
  instructor training to people who wish to teach at such events.

* Encourages and facilitates research in the public interest related
  to open education, particularly to the impact of Software Carpentry
  training in specific, and to the adoption of better computing
  practices and greater openness in research in general.
