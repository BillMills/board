## Executive Summary

The Software Carpentry Foundation Board met in August of 2015 to develop a strategic
plan for the organization. The resulting  plan, detailed in this document, contains 
the background and current status of the Software Carpentry Foundation. It also details 
the vision, mission, and values of the organization. Based on feedback from the 
community and the Steering Committee, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats 
have been identified and analyzed. Additionally,  a stakeholder analysis has been done. 
Based on the results from these analyses, several strategic issues have been identified. 
For each of these priorities, plans for how to solve them and as well as performance 
indicators for their solutions have been developed. Finally, strategies for meeting 
those performance requirements in a timely fashion have been laid out.

## About the Software Carpentry Foundation

The Software Carpentry project began in 1998. With the support of many 
organizations and volunteers, Software Carpentry iterated on its model over the 
course of the next decade and arrived at a two-day workshop training model 
(http://software-carpentry.org/scf/history.html). From 2012-2014, a grant from 
the Sloan Foundation helped to put Software Carpentry on a more stable 
financial footing.  In turn, that growth led to us starting a training program 
to teach instructors the basics of educational psychology and instructional 
design. The Software Carpentry Foundation was created in October 2014 to act as 
a governing body for the project.  Software Carpentry is a member organization 
of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States.

We are an international non-profit community of learner-educators dedicated to
helping scientists and researchers be more productive and reproducible in research
done using computational means. We do this by teaching better computing skills
and better teaching practices to our peers.

### Staff and Volunteers

Our paid staff include:

- Executive Director, Jonah Duckles
- co-Executive Director Gregory V. Wilson
- and Program Coordinator, Maneesha Sane. 

Through the support of our partners, additional
international coordinators dedicate time to our needs as well.

The staff is supported by a community of volunteers including an elected
Steering Committee, an invited Advisory Council, lesson maintainers, software
developers, and hundreds of instructors, curriculum developers, and helpers.

### Our Reason for Being

Many disciplines are today experiencing a significant increase in the amount 
of data that needs to be computationally processed and analyzed to produce 
the sought after results. Traditional training in the sciences neglects to teach
skills for using scientific computing to do productive, reproducible, and 
transparent research. The resulting lack of basic computing skills among 
researchers causes errors and inefficiencies in the scientific process. 
Additionally, a lack of awareness perpetuates poor research practices and 
insufficient evaluation of scientific products among scientists. Software 
Carpentry exists to advance the efficiency and quality of research by 
improving computing skills among researchers. 

Software Carpentry uses proven teaching practices 
to introduce scientists and researchers to best practices for scientific computing. 
These include task automation, documentation, testing, version control, data 
management and openness in science. These practices improve the efficiency and 
quality of research in the scientific process. To motivate the use 
of these practices, we demonstrate that implementing these skills increases the 
productivity of a researcher and reduces the risk of errors. To raise awareness 
and advance scientific endeavors, we cultivate an active and inclusive community 
with the aim of spreading these practices as widely as possible.

## Vision

The Foundation was established to promote reproducibility and reliability in
all branches of the sciences with the vision of enabling scientists to use
software and computing to become more efficient, reproducible, and effective.
However, the organization has to be sustainable to ensure that we can continue
this work into the future. Hence, the focus for our short term plans are on
ensuring that the organization is financially healthy, that our community
continues to thrive, that we as an organization manage to document or processes
to ensure transparency, and that our curriculum is maintained at the same high
level of quality.

In the longer term, our plans have a considerably wider scope.

### Penetrating Traditional Training

The ultimate goal for the Software Carpentry Foundation is that it will no 
longer be needed - everything that the organization teaches will have been 
meaningfully embedded in high school, undergraduate, and graduate curricula 
so that the demand for these skills is met without the need for Software 
Carpentry. We envision a future in which evidence-based training in computing 
is considered foundational and is therefore completely integrated as a core 
skill set in all levels and disciplines of education.

Every year, Software Carpentry runs more workshops in more locations.
It is therefore not unrealistic to believe that this vision of the 
future will be inevitable as Software Carpentry instructors and learners become 
teachers and professors. Additionally, mandates from grant-giving organizations 
to adopt best practices in research may incite universities to incorporate 
appropriate computing training for new researchers. This will self-perpetuate 
as the next generation of researchers will be convinced of the value of these 
practices and skills. Considering the increasing focus on computing in general, 
this future may be realized when coding has become one of the "3 Rs" in high 
schools. 

### Better Science and Research

We believe that education is the best means by which science can be improved 
across the globe. Our collective vision for a successful future includes a 
reality where the level of computational competence amongst researchers has 
increased to such a level that version control, automation, and open science 
tools enhancing reproducibility will be the norm for scientific processes 
and manuscripts.

In this future, all researchers: 

- are more efficient and productive
- embrace modern software engineering techniques
- demand documentation, testing, and version control in their work and the work
  of their peers
- transparently disseminate reusable software and data as a matter of course
- perceive extensible scientific software as a first class research product

These researchers will have raised the level of collaboration and computational 
analysis in 21st century science. In that event, Software Carpentry will be seen 
as instrumental to that development, be a global leader in these fields in 
the research training landscape and a key contributor to improved research outcomes.

### General Growth

Another vision of success, compatible with the others, imagines a sustainable 
growth for the foundation. While remaining a project with a well-connected and 
inclusive community, we envision hundreds of self-organized workshops every 
year, hundreds of frequent contributors to a growing pool of reusable lessons 
on a variety of topics, a community of instructors that implement evidence-based 
teaching practices, and routine inclusion in grant proposals and research 
initiatives. This includes the organization growing to teach learners from 
additional domains, nations, and languages. 

As we scale, Software Carpentry itself is likely to become a 
central place for storing high-quality lesson plans, sharing resources, and 
keeping research communities connected. For community connection, many have suggested 
a conference or annual gathering, in person, of our large, diverse community.

## Mission 

We aim to teach skills that promote reproduciblility and reliability in research.
To accomplish this, we focus on educating and supporting instructors, developing 
curricula and running workshops.

### Educating and supporting instructors

Our pool of knowledgeable, dedicated, active and engaged instructors are our 
greatest asset. To ensure the high quality of our instructors, all would-be
instructors go through either an in-person or online training course. This 
course focuses on teaching evidence-based strategies for how to teach people 
new concepts and techniques. The aim is to teach the would-be instructors 
how people learn, and specifically, how people learn things that may be 
considerably outside of their current skill set. A major point that is 
emphasized during this course is that it can be very challenging and 
difficult for people to learn the kinds of things that we teach. The 
effort required should not be underrated.

Following this course, a would-be instructor needs to teach to be considered
a certified Software Carpentry instructor. To ensure that a first-time
instructor has a smooth transition into teaching, we try to pair them up with   
experienced lead instructors during their first teaching occasions.

The Foundation also has a very active and supportive set of mentors in the 
form of the mentoring committee. This committee works on supporting existing
instructors with figuring out both the practicalities of teaching,
as well as the best way of communicating the curriculum to learners. The main
focus of the mentoring committee is to help instructors put the things we teach
them into practice. In addition, the committee is instrumental in ensuring that 
lesson developers get feedback on how their lessons fare in the real world.

### Developing curricula

Our instructors need a high-quality curriculum to teach from. To support that
effort, we assist and encourage our instructors to help with the development of
the curriculum. Our goal is to make it easy for people to contribute to 
development, to ensure that we get feedback on the curriculum from the widest 
audience possible.

We also have a set of very skilled and knowledgeable lesson maintainers. These
do considerable work on maintaining and developing the curriculum further. 
Together with our Executive Director, these form the core group of people who
work on deciding where the curriculum needs to go and how it will get there.

Last, but not least, we maintain the technical infrastructure necessary to make
the lesson material available to all who use them, whether they are teaching from it
or contributing to it. This infrastructure is at present focused on using GitHub
for development. We have a very dedicated team of volunteers who together with
the Executive Director work on the lesson development system, without which 
maintenance and development of new lessons would not be possible.

### Running workshops

Finally, our instructors and our curriculum join up to teach
a diverse pool of learners in many different institutions in many different 
countries. Currently, our main teaching format is the two-day workshop, which commonly
include modules on task automation using the shell, version control using Git,
and programming with either R or Python. To support the workshop effort, we have a 
set of very competent administrative staff, both employed by the foundation 
and our partners, who work with hosts to organize workshops. We are also 
fortunate to have a set of developers who work on creating administrative tools
to assist this effort.

While many workshops are still organized with the direct help of the administrative
staff, we are seeing an increase in self-organized workshops. We view this as
a natural and welcome development as our increasing set of instructors spread the
skills we teach into their native environs.

## Values

Our values as an organization have emerged from our community, guide our 
decisions, and flavor our interactions with those we serve.

### Science

Good science should through the use of computation be made easier, more 
transparent, verifiable, reproducible, extensible, and open. Additionally, 
good science informs both our curriculum and our teaching. 
We believe in using evidence-based teaching strategies to teach 
evidence-based computational practices.

### Empowerment 

We seek to empower and support all scientists and researchers, regardless of 
background or identity, because we believe that high-quality teaching and 
access to knowledge should be made widely available. It is only by enabling 
everybody to do high quality research we can ensure that the best science
is being done.

### Inclusion 

We recognize all contributions as equally important and valid for the 
development of the initiative. We are fair and provide equal 
opportunities, but we also recognize and understand that some groups 
may need extra encouragement and support to reach their full potential.

### Community

Everyone can learn, everyone can contribute, and everyone is responsible. We 
welcome all members to our community and seek to help them contribute. To 
sustain a healthy community, we insist on a respectful and fair code of conduct 
that help create a safe space for everybody. 

### Reach and Scope

Software Carpentry has over 400 instructors from multiple nations and has taught workshops
on 6 continents. As our curriculum is targeted at researchers in college and
beyond, the audience for our efforts is broad and international.


### Success

With the help its 21 organizational members, and 465 volunteer 
instructors, Software Carpentry has now successfully run over 500 workshops for 
at least 16,000 learners.

### Outlook

In 2016, we will have a new Executive Director and elect a new Steering 
Committee. This will mean both growth and change for the community. In that 
transition, we will strive to cultivate healthy partnerships with both our 
current and new organizational members and we will strive to maintain the high 
quality of our curriculum. We will also continue to support and be supported by
our active, inclusive community of instructors, helpers, learners, curriculum 
developers, and others devoted to our mission.


## Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats

In order to move forward with the project, the community and the steering committee were 
asked to participate in a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOTs), 
analysis. The survey, conducted in July 2015, asked for input from any and all
community members about the current SWOTs facing Software Carpentry and the
foundation. This survey received 49 responses, which were analyzed and
discussed at length by the Steering Committee in preparation for our in-person
Strategic Planning meeting. The planning meeting took place at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory on August 12 and 13, 2015 and followed the strategic planning
meeting guidelines in "Strategic Planning for Public and Non-Profit
Organizations," by John M. Bryson.

A summary of the key points of the SWOT analysis that took place based on the
survey and during that meeting, follows. 

### Strength: Relevance 

The lack of reproducibility and reliability in research is a relevant and 
practical concern that transcends domains. As an organization, we benefit from 
the relevance of our mission because we are fighting a battle that is extremely 
relevant, but which few people have tried to solve at scale.  By filling this gap in 
academic training, we engender interest and support from learners and 
volunteers for whom the advancement of science is a core value.  

### Strength: Leadership

Many members of the community have noted the importance of our leadership, and
the unstoppable crusader, Greg Wilson, in particular. The dedication of the 
leadership to the mission, the instructors, and the learners is essential to 
the experience of all that are involved in the project.

### Strength: Talent

We have a vast community of skilled, knowledgeable, friendly, motivated, 
enthusiastic volunteers from diverse backgrounds who teach expertly 
prepared lessons. We have succeeded precisely where we have invited everyone 
to contribute talent, time, and resources. 

### Strength: Community

We have a vast and international community of learners, instructors, lesson
developers and other supporters that is distributed but united. Additionally, 
we benefit from the strong support of a broad range of individuals, institutions, 
and partner organizations in our community. The diversity of these institutions and 
instructors, from a domain and geographical perspective, gives SCF an 
opportunity to spread our core principles and values across nations and 
institutions.  

### Strength: Quality

SCF is increasingly recognized and respected as the brand has been cultivated 
through many years of effort, experimentation, research, intention, 
transparency, and practice. The relevance of our instructors, as scientific 
peers to our learners, is as important as the relevance of the curriculum. 


### Strength: Inclusiveness

Our non-threatening, inclusive workshop model succeeds at demystifying coding, 
even for novices. Additionally, our collaborative model of curriculum 
development welcomes new contributors and improves content. Finally, the open 
and accessible distribution of our content and the affordability of our 
workshops has broadened our reach to more people and places than would otherwise be 
possible.


### Weakness: Scalability

There is a tension between the desire for geographic growth and the need to 
ensure that workshops maintain their high quality. While the community have 
expressed a desire to diversify the languages and nations that we serve, a 
simultaneous concern is to maintain quality during growth. A related concern 
is that we don't know yet whether we will be able to keep  our finances stable 
in the long run.

### Weakness: Documentation

Between the lack of clarity on the website, constant revisions of the 
curriculum, and the need for additional instructor mentorship, many community 
members have noted that clearer communication is necessary if instructors, new and 
old, are to be expected to keep up.

### Weakness: Assessment

It is necessary to prove the efficacy of Software Carpentry as a game changer 
in scientific research, but our current assessment system does not sufficiently   
capture learner outcomes.

### Opportunity: Collaboration

Collaborations with other universities, institutions, with MOOCs, and with new
partners opens up avenues for growth, quality, reach, and resources. To make
the most of the potential for these collaborations, Software Carpentry will
benefit from close relationships with its partners and affiliates in particular.

### Opportunity: Online Delivery

Since our material is online, a number of our learners never attend a workshop,
many learners who have been to workshops return to the website for additional
learning, and a greater breadth of learners can be reached. Online and
self-paced workshops may be a trend in the future of education and we have the
opportunity to be a testbed for those efforts. 


### Opportunity: Expansion

Software Carpentry is expanding its reach, both across domains and geographic
regions. While this presents a sustainability and growth management challenge,
it also presents an enormous opportunity. In addition to increased
accomplishment of our mission and greater access to new potential instructors
and community members, there may be additional ways in which this growth can be
beneficial to the organization as a whole. Our focus should be to make the most
of these opportunities.

### Threat: Quality Assurance

Ensuring quality while growing is a challenge that we will continually face.
Making the curriculum and instructor training pipeline as seamless and
supportive as possible will help us to control the quality of Software
Carpentry instruction. Leaks and weaknesses in that pipeline will fail the
instructors, the learners, and the foundation. 

### Threat: Sustainability

Sustainability is a challenge on many fronts -- financial, community, and
technology. Financially, SCF will need to revisit our projected sources of
income periodically and investigate more sustainable sources (such as grant
funding). Reliance on volunteers may be unsustainable in the long term, as may
be the reliance on an occasionally overburdened executive director. Possibly
most important, SCF and its curriculum must stay current with changes in
technology and best practices. 


### Threat: Branding

We have strong brand recognition in some communities and geographical regions,
but that brand is continuously at risk as we grow and change. Maintenance of
the brand recognition and reputation of the Software Carpentry name and
community. Potential degradation of that brand is a constant threat and
requires stewardship of curriculum and instruction quality. Similarly,
confusion around the brand will need to be managed as other Carpentry
initiatives form.

## Stakeholders

We have identified many stakeholders and have discussed their wants and needs.   
Primary stakeholders include:

- Executive Director
- Program Coordinator
- Other Workshop Coordinators
- Steering Committee Members
- Advisory Council Members
- Subcommittee Members
- Instructors
- Learners
- Helpers
- Hosts
- NumFOCUS
- Partners and Affiliates
- Data Carpentry
- Other Volunteers
- External Advocates
- Blog Readers
- Potential Grant Funders

Key things that we can provide to these stakeholders include:

- Financial Solvency
- Learner Assessment
- Robust Instructor Pipeline
- Available Instructor Training Sessions
- Outreach to New Learners
- Reliable Workshop Coordination
- Attractive Workshop Teaching Opportunities
- Timely Annual Report
- A Monthly Digest of News
- Clear Informative Blog Posts
- Clear Website Interface
- Clear Documentation of Instructor Processes
- Clear Internal Processes
- Transparent Foundation Reporting
- Rich Assessment of Impact
- Coordination with Data Carpentry

## Strategic Issues

Based on these SWOTs, as well as a lengthy assessment of our stakeholders and 
mission, the Steering Committee have arrived at the following major Strategic 
issues that will be our primary focus for the near term:

- Reporting and Transparency
- Documentation of Procedures 
- Instructor Pipeline Management 
- Coordination with Data Carpentry

These have been discussed above, distributed among the needs of the 
stakeholders, but are summarized below as strategic objectives.

### Reporting and Transparency

All of our stakeholders have some need related to reporting and transparency. 
Reporting and transparency include a number of ares of our efforts. In particular:

Financial: We are in need of well defined reporting expectations and standards
of our financial solvency and health. This will serve the foundation internally
as well as facilitate our interactions with potential funding avenues and
organizational members.  

Community: The community thrives on timely reporting of new events and news.
These can be in the form of an annual report or monthly digest from the board
and should be communicated to the community through our many channels.
 
Discoverability: The instructors, learners, and organizational members, will
all benefit from better discoverability of information on the website related
to everything from workshop curriculum to member guidelines and affiliation
agreements. 

Internal Organization: The Steering Committee functions are in need of clear
internal reporting for management of our needs and goals. This could include a
calendar of upcoming instructor trainings, up-to-date list of members,
tagged-github-issue-process for proposals, and a record of motions.  

### Documentation of Procedures 

A related but distinct need is the elucidation of procedures for the various
activities within Software Carpentry. For workshop coordination, these include
what to do when a request for a workshop comes through, when a workshop ball
gets dropped, when someone wants to run their own workshop, or when a new
learner completes training. For our foundation management, this includes what
to do when a funding lead arises, when the ED has a new idea or a change that
needs to be suggested, or when a staff member transitions to a new job

In particular, a process to onboard new instructors will serve the separate
instructor pipeline strategic goal, below. 

### Instructor Pipeline Management 

Given the importance of our instructors to every aspect of our mission and
vision, we should maintain better management of the pipeline through which they
proceed toward their first workshop. In that pipeline, we should:

- Reach out to learners so they know the pipeline for contributing to the
  community (invite all new learners to discuss list)
- Foster attractive workshop teaching opportunities
- Set up a group of volunteers for workshop lead development. That is, we
  should not just get requests for workshops, but make suggestions.
- Connect new instructors to their first workshop
- Formulate rules for who can run instructor training, how often, for how many people? 
- For a pilot phase, train 4 new instructor trainers.
- Additional instructor trainers will need to balance growth, quality, and sustainability.
- Formulate and enact process for certifying instructors
- Create curriculum for instructor training.

### Coordination with Data Carpentry

-   Coordinate DCF/SCF goals (shared committee meeting this year with CLEAR AGENDA, consistent reporting from ED about DCF at SC meetings, need a table on what we agree/disagree about)
-   Coordinate audiences for DCF/SCF training (plan should be included in above comprehensive mentoring/training/mini-lesson proposal)
-   Coordinate DCF/SCF cost sharing (need cost sharing proposal to consider in SC meeting soon)
-   Coordinate lesson content / format (shared committee meeting this year with CLEAR AGENDA, consistent reporting from ED about DCF at SC meetings)
-   Collaboration on funding proposals and potential partners (cost sharing proposal, consistent reporting from ED about DCF at SC meetings)




## Actions

For each of the strategic issues, we have additionally identified key 
performance indicators.
