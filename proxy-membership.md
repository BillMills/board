# Proxy members for the steering committee

In the event that a member of the steering committee is temporarily
unable to carry out their [duties][], they may appoint a proxy to act
on their behalf, delegating any or all of their powers to the proxy
member as they see fit.  A proxy must be an existing committee
member, and any single person may not be a proxy for more than one
committee member at any given meeting.
