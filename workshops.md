Workshop Fees and Operations
============================

Terminology
-----------

*   The terms *Organizational Member* refers to *Partners*,
    *Affiliates*, and *Sponsors* as defined in the description of
    organizational membership.

*   A *host* is an organization which is hosting a workshop.  It may or
    may not be an organizational member.

*   A *coordinator* is a member of staff of the SCF or of an
    Organizational Member who devotes a significant amount of time to
    arranging workshops.

*   An *internal* workshop is one whose audience is mainly from the host
    organization (e.g., a workshop run by the University of Melbourne
    for staff and students of the University of Melbourne)

Operations
----------

1.  Hosts are always responsible for instructors' travel and
    accommodation costs.

2.  Anyone who wants to organize and run a workshop using the Software
    Carpentry name and logo without the support of the SCF is free to
    do so provided they adhere to our rules about content and
    certified instructors. There is no charge for them doing this, and
    we will advertise it on our website provided they provide the
    information we require and allow us to administer our pre- and
    post-workshop surveys.

3.  Software Carpentry workshops that the SCF or its organizational
    members assist in organizing are subject to the following fees:

    a.  US$1250 for the first workshop in any year;

    b.  an additional US$750/workshop for the second and subsequent
        workshops in a year. (Thus, if a host organizes three
        workshops at once, we charge US$2750 (US$1250 + 2 x US$750),
        not US$3750.)

    Hosts can raise the money we require from registration fees (which
    may flow to us directly if we're handling registration), direct
    contributions, or a combination thereof.

4.  The SCF receives the first US$1000/year from each host per year,
    and US$250 per workshop per host site per year after that.  Part
    or all of the remainder may be kept by whichever SCF Partner or
    Affiliate handled the arrangements, or they may elect to give that
    to the SCF.  (So for a one-off, SCF gets US$1000 and the partner
    organization gets to decide what to do with the remaining US$250.
    For a batch of three, SCF gets US$1500 and the partner gets to
    decide whether to keep the other US$1250 or give some or all of it
    to SCF.)

5.  Workshop fees may be waived for internal workshops run by
    Partners.  Affiliates may receive a fee waiver for internal
    workshops in return for staff time, or may elect to pay an annual
    fee.

6.  The Steering Committee may reduce or waive workshop fees at its
    discretion.  In particular, Software Carpentry strives to be a
    global project and support a diverse set of organizations; any
    potential host that wishes to offer a workshop that would aid
    these goals is urged to contact the SCF to discuss waivers and
    other arrangements.

7.  All requests for workshops, no matter who receives them or how,
    are pooled in a central location that all coordinators can access.

8.  Once a workshop has been allocated to a coordinator, s/he can
    communicate with the host using either an organizational email
    address or a software-carpentry.org email address, whichever the
    organization prefers.  All conversations must be recorded in a
    shared central location approved by the Steering Committee (so
    that we don't have to dig around in people's private mail archives
    two years from now for conversations).

9.  All records of individuals' participation in workshops and
    training must be similarly recorded in a shared central location
    (e.g., a common database).  All organizations with access to that
    information must respect best practices for personal privacy (e.g,
    may not contact workshop participants about other activities
    without their explicit prior consent), and are expected to
    coordinate their use of that information with other organizational
    members of the SCF through the SCF Steering Committee and
    Executive Director.
