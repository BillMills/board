Summary
-------

* Introductions

* Date/time of next meeting
  * Agreed: Sept 30 at 19:30 UTC (audio + Etherpad only)

* Discussion of timeline
  * What are our preferred dates for:
    - public announcement
    - formalizing legal status
    - reconstituting the board
  * Obvious dates for public announcement include:
    - before Train the Trainers/MozFest in UK (Oct 22-26, 2014)
    - before U. Washington Train the Trainers (Nov 12-14, 2014)
  * General preference was October (ties in with grant cycles)
    - General consensus: earlier is better to avoid confusion in the community and reduce risk of inadvertent disclosure
  * Minimum that needs to be decided before announcement can be made:
    - that the SCF is being created (done)
    - that it has an interim board with representation from organizations and instructors (done)
    - that it will have non-profit status in the US (not decided - see below)
    - mission statement (draft attached for comments)
    - process for existing organizations providing support (turned into governance discussion summarized below)

* Governance
  * Individual (instructor/contributor) membership: uncontentious
  * Organizational/institutional/funder membership: many issues to resolve
    - Requirements for becoming an organizational member?
    - Does every organization supporting SCF get a board seat? (Could make for an unmanageably large board.)
      - KH: American Nuclear Society uses a percentage bar (so largest N contributors get seats)
      - JG: be careful not to conflate fundraising with governance
      - DI balance of institutional board members vs instructors, institutional not to outnumber instructors
      - NCH: 1/3 institutional, 1/3 instructors, 1/3 appointed is typical recommended UK charitable service foundation arrangement
  * Kinds of boards:
    - Python Software Foundation: large and active (most PSF work done by board members)
    - Mozilla Foundation: smaller; oversight rather than implementation
    - Eclipse Foundation: a large board that works successfully - could be a model in case of "catastrophic success" (DA)
    - Force11
  * Q&A
    - Do we have a governance document yet for stuff like voting, budget, throwing people out, etc.?
      - No
    - Is organizational membership the only way to contribute to Software Carpentry?
      - No: hope/expect people will write us into other grants, sponsor events (e.g., WiSE workshops), etc.
    - Is US 501(c)3 decided on?
      - No, but no other proposals have been made yet
    - Is NumFOCUS decided on?
      - No: GW will gather answers to questions in advance of Sept 30 meeting
      - Alternatives mentioned include Software Freedom Conservancy, a free-standing 501(c)3, a 501(c)6, or going through a university
    - How do people outside the US donate?
      - Unknown

* Operations
  * What is the core budget needed to operate minimum staff and what are the projections?
    - Action item below: create budget
  * Current effort:
    - Sloan/Mozilla: 1.0 FTE for project lead, 0.75 FTE for workshop coordination, but not all Software Carpentry
    - SSI: 0.5 FTE for workshop coordination, 0.5 to fill in training, plus seed funds for workshops
    - ELIXIR: 1.0 FTE admin plus seed funds for workshops
    - ResBaz: ??? (DI to fill in)
  * Required:

      - 1.0 FTE for project management/overall coordination/instructor training
      - 1.0 FTE for curriculum development
    - regionally/organizationally:
