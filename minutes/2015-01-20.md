        transition

        with partners and affiliates e.g. use of Train The Trainers in
        potential collaborations and what that implies for certification

        or should it be delegated to the ED? Convey the rationale for
        TTT being treated the way we do.

        -   13 candidates (see http://software-carpentry.org for list)
        -   DI has settled on ElectionBuddy as a platform
        -   We will mail all eligible voters later this week with
            instructions, then mail again on Monday Jan 26 to say
	    that voting is open
            -   that second email will be an automated email from the
                ElectionBuddy system

            officer
        -   we will have results by end of day (Pacific time) on Friday
            Jan 30
    -   roles that will be needed in steering committee?
        -   There is a document at https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/committee-roles.md
        -   chair
        -   treasurer
        -   secretary
    -   How will that go about getting organized?
        -   The SC will vote on a chair, then other members will put
            themselves forward for specific roles
        -   In case of conflict, they will vote
    -   Handover meeting Tuesday 3rd February, time TBD
-   SCF Financial Update (Budget Sub-Committee - TT)
    -   Membership fees in pipeline
    -   Bank balance: $8018.82
    -   Affiliate agreements out:
        -   BIDS $5000 for 1 year
        -   UC Davis $15000 for 3 years
        -   University of College London $5000 for 1 year
        -   NeSI are giving staff time instead of money
    -   Sponsors:
        -   RStudio for $1000
    -   Cashflow forecast
        -   Membership fees are being tracked
        -   Still an issue on tracking workshop fees
        -   how to coordinate MSL coordination with fees through
            NumFOCUS?
            -   KT: We've edited text for new workshops that point to
                the fee portion of the SCF website and direct people to
                Greg. Arliss cannot chase folks on fees, unfortunately
                (gets blurry quite quickly what our relationship is).
                Perhaps worth looking at events in the shared
                spreadsheet, pursue from there (either for NumFOCUS or
                Greg to drive?)
        -   Recommendation: Treasurer to decide what frequency of
            updates of forecast vs budget should be circulated to the
            different parts of SCF

        -   Leah Silen from NumFOCUS has put together a draft, and is
            waiting for input from lawyers.

    -   LBL (March)
    -   NIH (April 8-9)
    -   Michigan State (May 27-28)
    -   U. Florida (some time this autumn)

    -   Motion: Amend Governance document to allow co-opted appointed
        members of the Advisory Council drawn from the wider community
        by amending clause 5 to include the additional sub-clause:
        
        ~~~
        d. The Advisory Council may decide to co-opt additional
        persons to the Advisory Council from the wider community at
        any time, with a default term of one year. The number of
        co-opted members shall not exceed the number of partners and
        affiliates represented on the Advisory Council. Co-option
        shall be done by majority vote of the Steering Committee.
        ~~~

        Passed unanimously.

-   Motion: Invite previous SWC Advisory Board members not qualifying by
    virtue of member status to be co-opted on to the Advisory Council
    for one year.
    -   Passed
-   Motion: that Membership documentation be amended to add appointing a
