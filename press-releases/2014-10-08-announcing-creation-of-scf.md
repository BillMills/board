In order to foster Software Carpentry's continued growth, we are
pleased to announce that we are creating an independent Software
Carpentry Foundation (SCF).  Like other non-profit open source
foundations, it will decide Software Carpentry's overall scope and
direction, manage finances, and hold its intellectual property.

In order to work through the details, we have assembled an interim
board drawn from a wide cross-section of our community:

- Jenny Bryan (University of British Columbia, Canada)
- Neil Chue Hong (University of Edinburgh / Software Sustainability Institute, UK)
- Carole Goble (University of Manchester / ELIXIR UK)
- Josh Greenberg (Sloan Foundation, USA, non-voting)
- Katy Huff (University of California Berkeley, USA)
- Damien Irving (University of Melbourne / Research Platforms, Australia)
- Adam Stone (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA)
- Tracy Teal (Michigan State / Data Carpentry, USA)
- Kaitlin Thaney (Mozilla Science Lab, USA)
- Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry, Canada)

This group's mandate is to draft the SCF's initial bylaws and get the
foundation legal standing, then arrange the transition to the first
permanent board some time early in 2015.  Until then, we will continue
to do what we have always done: teach scientists and engineers how to
use computers to do more research in less time and with less pain.

Our thanks to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation,
the Software Sustainability Institute, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
Research Bazaar, and everyone else listed on
http://software-carpentry.org/pages/sponsors.html for their
sponsorship, and to all of our volunteer instructors for making
Software Carpentry possible.
