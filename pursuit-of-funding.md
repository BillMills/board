Pursuit of Funding
==================

*   Steering Committee members may pursue diverse sources of funding to
    support Software Carpentry.

*   Any discussions with funding sources will be clearly stated to be
    just discussions when talking with organizations.

*   Any planned points of contact will be noted in the Git repository
    and in an email sent to the Steering Committee.

*   Any Steering Committee member has one week to ask that a given
    organization not be contacted.  If a dissent is made, that contact
    will go to a Steering Committee vote.

*   Multiple Steering Committee members may be involved in a
    conversation, but one person will be designated as the lead
    contact with that organization.

*   Results of any conversation will be reported in the Git repository
    and in an email sent to the Steering Committee.

*   Again these are discussions and no agreements will be made with any
    affiliate or organization without Steering Committee approval.
