Pursuit of Funding
==================

*   Board members may pursue diverse sources of funding to support
    Software Carpentry.

*   Any discussions with funding sources will be clearly stated to be
    just discussions when talking with organizations.

*   Any planned points of contact will be noted in the Git repository
    and in an email sent to the Board.

*   Any Board member has one week to ask that a given organization not
    be contacted.  If a dissent is made, that contact will go to a
    Board vote.

*   Multiple Board members may be involved in a conversation, but one
    person will be designated as the lead contact with that
    organization.

*   Results of any conversation will be reported in the Git repository
    and in an email sent to the Board.

*   Again these are discussions and no agreements will be made with any
    affiliate or organization without Board approval.
